# Social Media Demo

This is a full-stack social media demo I made as my capstone project for my certification course with Per Scholas

## Structure:

The **/backend** folder contains an ExpressJS server, acting as a proxy to connect to MongoDB, routing requests to the app's storage of user data, as well as posts, comments, and account profiles

The **/site-frontend** folder is a ReactJS App built with Vite, which acts as the primary client-side UI

## Planned Features:

Going forward, I want to implement:

- Increased password requirements
- Email verification on account creation
- Storage for files and other forms of multimedia for posts
- Support for Unicode and other rich text markdown
- Internal messaging
- Search feature using the pre-existing tagging system
